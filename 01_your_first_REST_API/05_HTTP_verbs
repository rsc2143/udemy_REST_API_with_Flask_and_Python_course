Web server : Piece of software designed to accept incoming requests.
Eg:When we go to http://www.google.com, we send the following:

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.google.com

GET request:
  GET / HTTP/1.1
    Here- GET is a verb
          / is the path
          HTTP is the protocol

Responses from the server to any request:
- Server may give an error, if / or path is not found
- Server may give an error, if HTTP is not supported
- Server may give an error, if server is not available
- Server may give HTML code back
- Server may give back text
- Server may not give anything

Examples of different page responses:
- If we go to https://twitter.com/login
    GET /login HTTP/1.1
    Host: https://twitter.com

- If we go to https://git-scm.com/download/mac
    GET /download/mac HTTP/1.1
    Host: https://git-scm.com


So the forward slash or / is the root

HTTP verbs:
  GET
  POST
  DELETE
  PUT
  OPTIONS
  HEAD

 verb       meaning                             Examples
 GET        Retrieve something                  GET / item/1
 POST       Receive data, and use it            POST /item
 PUT        Make sure something is there        PUT /item
 DELETE     Remove something                    DELETE /item/1

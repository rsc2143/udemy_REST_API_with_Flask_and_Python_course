What is an API?
In this course we're going to be building our own APIs.

An API is a program that takes in some data and gives back some other data, usually after processing it.

We will be building such programs, so that our users can send us some data, we can process it, and then we can send them something else.

For example, Twitter Search. Twitter search accepts data (the search parameters), processes it (finds the tweets that match those parameters), and sends data back (the tweets themselves).

If you are a user of the Twitter Search API, you can send them the search parameters and you get back the tweets.

If you are the developer of the Twitter Search API, you write code that accepts those search parameters, finds tweets in your database, and sends them back to the user.

---

If you want to interact with an API—that is, you want to be the user of the API—we've written a blog post about it: https://blog.tecladocode.com/how-to-interact-with-apis-using-python/

The rest of the course focuses on building APIs, not using them!

Happy coding,

Jose

What is a REST API?
- Its a way of thinking how a web server responds to your requests
- It doesnt respond with just data
- It responds with resources

Resources

Example, we have a chair element of the item resource
So we can have following resources

GET /item/chair
POST /item/chair    with some extra data
PUT /item/chair     with some extra data
DELETE /item/chair

Stateless
- It means that one request cannot depend on another requests
- Eg
Example 1
  POST /item/chair creates a chair
  The server doesnt know it has created a chair. It created it, updated it in the database and then forgot about it
  GET /item/chair then goes to the database, checks if it exists and then retrieves it.

Example 2
A user logs into twitter.com
The server does not know the user is logged in, since the server is Stateless
The web application must send enough data to identify the user in every request, or else the server wont associate the request
with the user
